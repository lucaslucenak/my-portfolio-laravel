            <p align= 'justify'>When I was 12 I decided to be a developer. Since I was a child, had a lot of affinity with
                technology,
                I used to assemble and disassemble computers, watch videos about how software and hardware technologies
                works "under the hood".
                At 18 started to study Computer Science in State University of Para√≠ba convinced that this was the way that
                a want do take,
                and with each new thing I learn I get even more sure of this decision! Programming and learning new things
                became leisure for me, not exactly a job.</p>
